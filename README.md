# OXYGENShop

OXYGENShop is the first project part of the training at OXYGEN Academy. It is the landing page for a fictional shop. The second project at the Academy was to implement JavaScript features to the existing landing page. All features were developed from 0 by myself without taking the components from the internet. It was a great chance to understand how JavaScript works and how to divide a task into smaller steps. With this approach it was easier to reach the final goal. Key functionalities:

 - Page progress bar based on total page height.
 - Back to top button that appear when the user is at the end of the page.
 - Form validation and posting data to an external API.
 - A modal to subscribe to the newsletter shows five seconds after page load or if the user scrolls more than 25%. Four ways to close the modal: by clicking the x, but pressing the ESC key, by clicking outside of the modal or by submiting the subscription to the newsletter. Once the modal opens it gets stored in Local Storage and it will not show again when the user visits the website again (if visiting from the same browser).
 - Currency converter that takes the todayÂ´s exchange rates from an external API everytime the user changes the currency and updates the amounts to the desired currency.
 - Image slider that slides every five seconds or after user input (clicks on the arrows or on the dots).
